1. What does the dollar ($) sign do?
The dollar ($) sign is used to create absolute cell references in Excel formulas. By using the dollar sign before the column and/or row reference, you can lock the reference in a formula so that it doesn't change when copied to other cells.

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
You can change the reference from relative to absolute (or mixed) by using the dollar sign. To create an absolute reference, use a dollar sign ($) before the column letter and/or row number. To create a mixed reference, use a dollar sign before either the column letter or row number.

3. Explain the order of operations in Excel.
The order of operations in Excel follows the acronym PEMDAS:
1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
Formulas in Excel are calculated based on this order of operations.

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in Excel, and write a basic syntax for any two?
a. COUNTIF(): =COUNTIF(range, criteria)
b. SUMIF(): =SUMIF(range, criteria, sum_range)
c. EXACT(): =EXACT(text1, text2)
d. RANK(): =RANK(number, ref, [order])
e. VLOOKUP(): =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

5. When would you use the SUBTOTAL function?
The SUBTOTAL function is useful when you want to calculate totals or perform other aggregate functions on a filtered range of data. It can be used to ignore rows that are hidden or excluded by a filter and calculate subtotals for specific categories.

6. What is the syntax of the VLOOKUP function? Explain the terms in it.
The syntax of the VLOOKUP function is as follows:
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
- lookup_value: The value you want to look up in the first column of the table.
- table_array: The range of cells that represents the table where the lookup value is located.
- col_index_num: The column number in the table from which the matching value should be returned.
- range_lookup: An optional argument that specifies whether the lookup should be an exact match (FALSE) or an approximate match (TRUE or omitted).
